# HopeHarbour

## Inspiration
We saw once that some people were distributing food to people in the streets and taking photos. But then, they abruptly stopped and left the place even though they had more food and more people were still waiting to get the food. We couldn't understand the reason for their actions and we were very angry at them for doing this. But from that, we got the idea that we can make a donation app that uses blockchain to decentralize payments so the general populace can track what happened to their money and by whom it was taken, for what, etc. They can question certain transactions and ask about the need for it to make the system more reliable and corruption-proof.

## What it does
It gives people the option to donate to the website for different causes and track down payments. The website is made very accessible so it is easy to read for screen readers and people with disabilities can also use the website.

## How we built it
We built it using basic HTML and CSS with JavaScript. It uses Bootstrap for CSS and some custom style elements also.

## Challenges we ran into
We tried to implement the use of Verbwire API to get transactions to be on the blockchain and get the transaction history of all the donations on the blockchain. But we faced problems implementing the node js package and making the API work

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that at least we were able to submit a project to this prestigious event and made some contributions to society by making this website. Also, we are proud that we learned about the use of APIs and Node JS but unfortunately were not able to implement it all.

## What we learned
We learned about a new API Verbwire and how to use it to create transactions and NFTs. We also learned the use of NodeJS

## What's next for Hope Harbour
We will try to actually implement the blockchain and make it all work together with a better UI and some more functionality like giving NFTs to donors.
